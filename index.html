        <h1>Welcome to Yu-Gi-Oh!</h1>
        <p>
            If you are someone who was born in the mid to late 90's or early 2000's and watched a lot of Cartoon Network, chances are you may have seen a Japanese Anime by the name Yu-Gi-Oh!. 
            When I was a kid i used to watch it whenever I could, facinated by the different art style, the monster designs, and the admittedly terrible plot. The monsters and other cards played 
            though were by far the most interesting part of the show. Dark Magician and Red-Eyes Black Dragon were so cool, when I learned that there were real cards associated with the show I 
            had to have them. My brother and I bought decks and would play against each other, just like in the anime. 
            <br>
            <br>
            But that was the problem, not only did the anime not follow the rules of the 
            Trading Card Game (TCG), but my beloved Red-Eyes and Dark Magician were awful in the real game. I'd come back to the trading card game now and again even after I aged out of the anime. 
            I always wanted to learn how to play but never had anyone else near me who was interested. And then COVID hit. 
            <br>
            <br>
            During quarantine I got really board and stumbled across a Yu-Gi-Oh! YouTube 
            channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrEMDvUyGV1p66Vf5P0O1pg">Cimoooooooo</a>, doing a series that went through all of the card sets ever released and dueling his friend. 
            In watching them and others to follow I slowly both how the game used to be played and how it is played today and those differences are what I want to detail here. Join me as I detail 
            how the game was played in the original Anime, how it was actually played in the TCG during the time of the original Anime, and how the TCG of today is a completely different beast.
